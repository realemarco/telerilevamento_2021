?mite #cos√¨ vedo info sul dataset 

#Oribatid mite data. 70 soil cores collected by Daniel Borcard in 1989. 
#See Borcard et al. (1992, 1994) for details.

#There are three linked data sets: 
 # mite that contains the data on 35 species of Oribatid mites, 
 # mite.env that contains environmental data in the same sampling sites, 
 # mite.xy that contains geographic coordinates, and mite.pcnm that contains 22 PCNM base functions (columns) computed from the geographic coordinates of the 70 sampling sites (Borcard & Legendre 2002). 

#The whole sampling area was 2.5 m x 10 m in size.
